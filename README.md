# Customer Churn Prediction (Banking & Insurance)

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn in the banking and insurance sectors. By analyzing customer behavior and transactional data, we can identify customers likely to leave a bank or switch insurance providers, allowing businesses to take proactive retention measures.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle's Bank Churn Dataset or simulated insurance customer data.
- **Features**:
  - Customer demographics (age, gender, etc.)
  - Account balance and transaction history
  - Loan and credit history
  - Tenure with the company
  - Customer engagement metrics
  - Previous complaints or service interactions
- **Target Variable**: Churn (1 = customer left, 0 = customer retained)

## 🛠 Key Technologies & Skills
- **Predictive Modeling**
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Neural Networks (ANN)
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
- **Survival Analysis** (Optional, to model churn over time)
- **Evaluation Metrics**
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - ROC-AUC Curve

## 🚀 Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical features
   - Feature scaling
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding feature distributions
   - Identifying correlations
   - Visualizing churn patterns
3. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Implementing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks
   - Hyperparameter tuning
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Comparing models using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC
5. **Predictions & Insights**
   - Identifying key factors driving churn
   - Providing actionable insights for customer retention

## 📊 Results & Insights
- Feature importance analysis
- Churn probability segmentation
- Recommendations for reducing churn
